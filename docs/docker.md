# Installing Prereqs

_Tapdance takes a **docker-first** approach and requires python for orchestration of docker. If you've not yet installed docker and python, please refer to the instructions below._

## Windows

1. First install [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install).
    * _This will require you to open an administrative command prompt and copy-paste the installation command._
2. Once you have Chocolatey, install docker and python with:

    ```cmd
    choco install -y python docker
    ```

## Mac

1. First install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

## Linux
